/*
  BUG  
  
  Do not use this to compile the stylesheet for the CkEditor
  This prepends everything in the stylesheet with a ckeditor class

  but some elements cannot be prepended:
  - :root
  - html, body

  Doing so will lead to incorrect preview of the CkEditor

  For the time being:
  - compile this file
  - copy paste style.css into __ck5.style.css
  - adjust CSS accordingly (very time consuming)

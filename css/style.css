    This stylesheet is intentionally left blank until you recompile the style.scss for this subtheme.
    If no SCSS customizations need to be done, this theme loads all its style from the parent theme (@see ...info.yml)

    ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
    IMPORTANT - Any customization that cannot be achieved by recompiling style.scss doesn't belong here, 
    ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑   Is should go in style-custom.css
